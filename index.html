    <p> Hi, I am Wong Wen Bing, the President of my CCA, Chinese Orchestra. I joined Chinese Orchestra in Secondary 1 as I felt interested in Chinese music and wanted to try something different from primary school. I was playing an instrument called a <em>sheng</em>. Gradually, I became an integral part of the orchestra, performing in many different performances such as the Chinese New Year performances in Secondary 2, to the most significant Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) in Secondary 3, before signing off with the Annual Awards Day performance in Secondary 4. </p>
    <p> I am immensely grateful to my CCA teahcers for providing multiple platforms for me to grow, inspire and work with others. </p>
