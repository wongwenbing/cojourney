    <p> Hi, I am Wong Wen Bing, the President of my CCA, Chinese Orchestra. I joined Chinese Orchestra in Secondary 1 as I felt interested in Chinese music and wanted to try something different from primary school. I was playing an instrument called a <em>sheng</em>. Gradually, I became an integral part of the orchestra, performing in many different performances such as the Chinese New Year performances in Secondary 2, to the most significant Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) in Secondary 3, before signing off with the Annual Awards Day performance in Secondary 4. </p>
    <p> I am immensely grateful to my CCA teahcers for providing multiple platforms for me to grow, inspire and work with others. </p>

<h2 id="2020"> My Journey in Year 2020 </h2>
<p> After growing in secondary 1, when I was introduced to my instrument, and I had to self-learn how to play the instrument, I was given the chance to perform at multiple events, 
<h3> My representation in the Music Leadership Camp 2020 </h3>
<p> I was selected to participant in the Music Leadership, which was organised by the Ministry of Education  </p>
<h4> Production of E-CCA Open-House Video 2020 </h4>
<p> When I returned from the Music Leadership Camp, I was tasked by my CCA teachers to do up a CCA video introducing our CCA to the Secondary One Students. 
<h5> My Reflections from producing the CCA video </h5>
<ul> 
<li> I was able to produce a decent video from producing in such a short time. Although there were some areas that need improvement, given the circumstances. </li>
<li> Areas for improvement: 
<ol> 
<li> Duration of the video. The duration of the video was too long and might be boring for our target audience: Sec1 students. As such, concise message and introduction should be needed. </li>
<li> Design and general structure of the video</li>
</ol> 
<li> One good part of the CCA video was that we were able to essentially cover the introduction of all our sections and a simple introduction from our EXCO members. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="SYF"> My SYF Journey </h2> 
<p> I was selected to be participate in the Singapore Youth Festival 2021 (SYF). When I first participated, I often felt a sense of nervousness that I would screw up. However, I was constantly being pushed on by my peers, seniors and instructors that would constantly motivate me to do my best.
<h3> Actual day of performance </h3> 
<p> We had to report early in the morning by 6am to have a final round of practice before leaving for the Singapore Conference Hall. Many of us were anxious and trying our best to stay calm. Before we left, we had a small pep talk by the principals, teachers who came to wish us good luck. </p> 
<h3>Our performance </h3>

<h2 class="Pres"> My journey during my role as President of Chinese Orchestra </h2> 
<h3> E-CCA </h3> 
<p> Once I took over from my predecessor, the COVID-19 pandemic worsened again and we were forced to resort to online practices for the majority of the second half of 2022. However, my committee and I have worked tirelessly to ensure that our members are being engaged online through practices and collaboration sessions. </p> 
<h4> Teacher's Day Performance: A student-initiated project </h4> 
    <p> As part of the Teachers' Day celebration led by the Student Council, the students in Chinese Orchestra were able to contribute a performance item for the Teacher's Day concert. This song is called <em> "Way Back Home" </em> by <em> Shaun </em>  
      Context: We were unable to meet face-to-face for any prior practice sessions due to COVID-19 restrictions, hence we had to practice via zoom. Some of us had to learn  </p>

  <h3> Digitalisation </h3> 
    <p> As part of the school's digitalisation processes, every student had an access to an iPad, a Microsoft Teams account. Furthermore, there was a need to reach out to new Secondary One students as it was observed that there was a decreasing trends. <p>
    <h4> Creation of the CCA Microsoft Teams </h4> 
    <p> There were multiple reasons for creating the Microsoft Teams as listed below. </p> 
    <ol> 
      <li> Increasing further communication between members and the committee. 
 Through the Microsoft Teams, students are able to directly message any member of the committee without going through the Section Leader, who would then have to relay the message with the relevant committee members. </li>
  <li> Allowing members to access relevant information.
     The benefit is that students are able to access CCA schedules, CCA seating plans and many other information. </li> 
      <li> Members are able to collaborate for relevant projects.
     <p>Members are able to communicate through Microsoft Teams and collaborate </p> </li>

<h4> Digitalisation of CCA Processes </h4> 
<p> I often found many of the CCA processes too rigid and that some of these processes could be digitalised. </p>

<h5> Submissions of Parent Letters and Medical Certificates (MC) </h5>
