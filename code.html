<h3> E-CCA </h3> 
<p> Once I took over from my predecessor, the COVID-19 pandemic worsened again and we were forced to resort to online practices for the majority of the second half of 2022. However, my committee and I have worked tirelessly to ensure that our members are being engaged online through practices and collaboration sessions. </p> 
<h4> Teacher's Day Performance: A student-initiated project </h4> 
    <p> As part of the Teachers' Day celebration led by the Student Council, the students in Chinese Orchestra were able to contribute a performance item for the Teacher's Day concert. This song is called <em> "Way Back Home" </em> by <em> Shaun </em>  
      Context: We were unable to meet face-to-face for any prior practice sessions due to COVID-19 restrictions, hence we had to practice via zoom. Some of us had to learn  </p>

  <h3> Digitalisation </h3> 
    <p> As part of the school's digitalisation processes, every student had an access to an iPad, a Microsoft Teams account. Furthermore, there was a need to reach out to new Secondary One students as it was observed that there was a decreasing trends. <p>
    <h4> Creation of the CCA Microsoft Teams </h4> 
    <p> There were multiple reasons for creating the Microsoft Teams as listed below. </p> 
    <ol> 
        <a href="https://postimg.cc/t7Vbs9Fg" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nV3hwzzq/IMG-7185.jpg" alt="IMG-7185"/></a><br/><br/>
      <li> Increasing further communication between members and the committee. 
 Through the Microsoft Teams, students are able to directly message any member of the committee without going through the Section Leader, who would then have to relay the message with the relevant committee members. </li>
        
  <li> Allowing members to access relevant information.
     The benefit is that students are able to access CCA schedules, CCA seating plans and many other information. </li> 
      <li> Members are able to collaborate for relevant projects.
     <p>Members are able to communicate through Microsoft Teams and collaborate </p> </li>

<h4> Creation of CCA Website </h4> 
<p> Click <a href="sites.google.com/view/beattychineseorchestra"> here</a> for the website. I will be guiding the navigation around here!</p>
    <p> There were multiple needs and purposes of our CCA website. As Chinese Orchestra is a more traditional form of music, it has been observed that over the years, the number of students joining our CCA has been decreasing. As such, by creating the website, I hope that students can find out MORE about our CCA and feel intersted to join us! </p> 
<h5> 'Home' Pages </h5>   
      <a href="sites.google.com/view/beattychineseorchestra"> Click here! </a>      
<p> This section is a basic introduction of our CCA as a whole. The background image was designed by one of our members, Jia Shuen, and hence we resorted to that design. For this section, which consists of the 'Home' and 'About Me' Pages, it was simply a simple introduction for us to introduce the basic details to the new Secondary one Students. </p> 
<h5> 'Our Sections' Pages </h5>

<h4> Digitalisation of CCA Processes </h4> 
<p3> I often found many of the CCA processes too rigid and that some of these processes could be digitalised. </p3>
