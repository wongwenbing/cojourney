<h3> E-CCA </h3> 
<p> Once I took over from my predecessor, the COVID-19 pandemic worsened again and we were forced to resort to online practices for the majority of the second half of 2022. However, my committee and I have worked tirelessly to ensure that our members are being engaged online through practices and collaboration sessions. </p> 
<h4> Teacher's Day Performance: A student-initiated project </h4> 
    <p> As part of the Teachers' Day celebration led by the Student Council, the students in Chinese Orchestra were able to contribute a performance item for the Teacher's Day concert. This song is called <em> "Way Back Home" </em> by <em> Shaun </em>.  
      Context: We were unable to meet face-to-face for any prior practice sessions due to COVID-19 restrictions, hence we had to practice via zoom. Some of us had to learn by ourselves, of which it was considered a no mean feat given that we had academic commitments to balance with. </p>

  <h3> Digitalisation </h3> 
    <p> As part of the school's digitalisation processes, every student had an access to an iPad, a Microsoft Teams account. Furthermore, there was a need to reach out to new Secondary One students as it was observed that there was a decreasing trends. <p>
    <h4> Creation of the CCA Microsoft Teams </h4> 
    <p> There were multiple reasons for creating the Microsoft Teams as listed below. </p> 
    <ol> 
        <a href="https://postimg.cc/t7Vbs9Fg" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nV3hwzzq/IMG-7185.jpg" alt="IMG-7185" width="600" height="400" class="center"/></a><br/><br/>
      <li> Increasing further communication between members and the committee. 
 Through the Microsoft Teams, students are able to directly message any member of the committee without going through the Section Leader, who would then have to relay the message with the relevant committee members. </li>
        <p> </p> 
        <a href="https://postimg.cc/GB2wdRcd" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xdG0GjhJ/IMG-7187.jpg" alt="IMG-7187" class="center" width="410" height="400"/></a><br/><br/>


  <li> Allowing members to access relevant information.
     The benefit is that students are able to access CCA schedules, CCA seating plans and many other information. </li> 
      <li> Members are able to collaborate for relevant projects.Members are able to communicate through Microsoft Teams and collaborate such as discussing their musical ways, or even collaborating to discuss how the CCA can be made more inclusive. </li>
 </ol> 

<h4> Creation of CCA Website </h4> 
<p> 
    <style>
        font-family: Trebuchet MS; 
        font-size: 20px; 
        text-align: justify;
    </style> 
    Click <a href="sites.google.com/view/beattychineseorchestra"> here</a> for the website. I will be guiding the navigation around here!</p>
    <p> There were multiple needs and purposes of our CCA website. As Chinese Orchestra is a more traditional form of music, it has been observed that over the years, the number of students joining our CCA has been decreasing. As such, by creating the website, I hope that students can find out MORE about our CCA and feel intersted to join us! </p> 
<h5> 'Home' Pages </h5>   
      <a href="sites.google.com/view/beattychineseorchestra"> Click here! </a>      
<p> This section is a basic introduction of our CCA as a whole. The background image was designed by one of our members, Jia Shuen, and hence we resorted to that design. For this section, which consists of the 'Home' and 'About Me' Pages, it was simply a simple introduction for us to introduce the basic details to the new Secondary one Students. </p> 
<h5> 'Our Sections' Pages </h5> 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/beattychineseorchestra/our-sections?authuser=0"> Click here! </a> 
<p> The section here is an introduction of our CCA. This served to  </p>
<h5> 'Our Performances'Pages </h5> 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/beattychineseorchestra/our-performances?authuser=0"> Click here! </a> 
<p> This section of pages consists of multiple showcases that the orchestra has put up, especially our SYF, which were very significant to us. </p> 
<h5> Our Experiences </h5>
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/beattychineseorchestra/our-experiences?authuser=0"> Click here! </a>
<p> As seen from the above, we had some members who had offered to list their experiences. These experiences would prove fruitful to the Sec1s that can be able to make a wiser choice such as the opportunities to develop as a leader and as a person.  </p> 
<h5> Our Activities </h5> 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/beattychineseorchestra/our-activities?authuser=0"> Click here! </a>
<p> This section of pages mention about the many different activities that our orchestra do, besides the usual practices to keep our members engaged. </p>
<h4> Digitalisation of CCA Processes </h4> 
<p3> I often found many of the CCA processes too rigid and that some of these processes could be digitalised. </p3> 
<h5> CCA Attendance </h5>
    <table> 
    <thead> 
        <tr> 
            <th> Before </th> 
            <th> After </th> 
        </tr>
        </thead> 
    <tbody> 
        <tr> 
            <td> <a href='https://postimg.cc/K4ndV6bR' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/T2SfyxHq/IMG-7203.jpg' border='0' alt='IMG-7203' width="450" height="600" scale="auto"/></a></td> 
            <td> <a href='https://postimg.cc/1f3JH23x' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/Nf1Sgwh0/Screenshot-2022-07-26-at-10-53-00-PM.png' border='0' alt='Screenshot-2022-07-26-at-10-53-00-PM' width="450" height="600"/></a> </td> 
        </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table> 
<p> A problem that I noticed was that our secretaries had difficulties identifying who was present. The orginal attendance was arranged by name, and hence difficult to identify by sections. Furthermore, it is printed and hence it does not prove to be environmentally-friendly and would be troublesome as we need to wait for our CCA teacher to print out the sheets. </p> 
      
<p> After the change in systems, the secretaries have feedbacked to us that they found it much more convenient for them.  </p>
<h5> Submissions of Parent Letters and Medical Certificates (MC) </h5>
      <a href="https://postimg.cc/w1F8CMYw" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pdMWn5GM/IMG-7188.jpg" alt="IMG-7188" width="400" height="400" class="center "/></a><br/><br/>
<p> During COVID-19, many members were unable to submit their parent letters and MCs to us for it to be keyed into the school system. As such, we developed the form such that the submissions could reach us prompty and that the school system would be able to show a VR sign as soon as possible. </p> 
    
<h5> Instrument Loans </h5> 
<div class="center">
      <table> 
    <thead> 
        <tr> 
            <th> Before </th> 
            <th> After </th> 
        </tr>
        </thead> 
    <tbody> 
        <tr> 
            <td> <a href='https://postimg.cc/2Lj39X0g' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/XqdFJRdN/IMG-7349.jpg' border='0' alt='IMG-7349'width="400" height="400" class="center" /></a></td> 
            <td> <a href="https://postimg.cc/jLHrhvg0" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PrcrTR1x/IMG-7195.jpg" alt="IMG-7195" width="350" height='500'/></a></td> 
        </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table> 
      </div> 
      <p> Originally, the loanbook was printed out, and it had many different pages. I noticed that the pages would often be torn off unintentionally, and hence this may not be an accurate way to keep track, as some records might disappear. </p> 
      <p> With the new loanbook, members can submit their loans efficiently, and the loans can be aaccounted more quickly. Furthermore, this system is definitely more fool-proof as it cannot be easily tapered with.</p>
