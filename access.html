<p> After growing in secondary 1, when I was introduced to my instrument, and I had to self-learn how to play the instrument, I was given the chance to perform at multiple events,although due to COVID-19, we were not able to perform much. One such event was the Chinese New Year concert in school, I learnt how to calm my nerves and play the song well.  
<h3> My representation in the Music Leadership Camp 2020 </h3>
<p> I was selected to participant in the Music Leadership Camp, which was organised by the Ministry of Education Arts Education Branch. This camp was held online due to COVID-19 and it lasted for 2 and a half days online. We were asked to record a video of us performing a selected piece of which I will share more below. Moreover, there were talks scheduled for us such as a Keynote Lecture on Leadership by ME4 Ignatius Wang, conducting lessons by SCO conductor Mr Quek Ling Yong, among many others. This camp allowed me to grow as a leader to lead and cooperate with others.  </p>
    <h4> Virtual Music Making </h4> 
    <p> We were taught how to use a simple video-making app, Kinemaster in order to do our music making. Everyone had to learn and pick up these skills for music making. Firstly, we were given a task to learn and record our performance of the song <em>"Kreta Ayer B"</em>. Personally for me, it was hard for me as I had just been in the CCA for 2 years and I could not learn the song myself, as I had always been dependent on my instructors. Thankfully, my group member, Johnathan, assisted me, and I was able to learn the song. This hence, gave me a huge opportunity ti grow Next, we had to send our recordings and let someone in the group edit. At the time, I was the editor of the video, but in the end, I had reached some difficulties regarding the editing of the video. Thankfully, I had Yu Xuan, who took over the editing of the videos and taught me how to do so in the shortest time. This was another great opportunity to grow. As seen in the video below, it turned out great! </p>

    <p> As seen from the video, there were some catchy phrases. As a result, we were able to win the award for "The Most Entertaining Group". </p> 

<h5> My reflections</h5> 
<ul> 
  <li> As a Secondary 2 student, this provided me an enormous platform to grow. I am really grateful to everyone, especially my group members, for guiding me in the process. The below photos summarised our group, and it was a really fun and enjoyable process. </li>

  <h4> Talks conducted by external guests </h4>

    <p> As seen from the camp booklets on pages 5 to 13, here were many talks that were conducted to allow us as students to know more and learn more as we take up leadership roles in our CCA. Such talks were extremely meaningful to me, as I picked up many new skills that were relatable to me, such as man-management. </p> 
    <p> One extremely memorable talk for me was the "Keynote lecture on Effective Musical Leadership" by ME4 Ignatius Wang. This talk constantly highlighted how we, as CCA leaders are able to asssist our teachers, our conductors. It taught me very valuable skills to bring forward to my further experience in 2021 as a CCA Presidet. </p>
