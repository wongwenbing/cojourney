<p> After growing in secondary 1, when I was introduced to my instrument, and I had to self-learn how to play the instrument, I was given the chance to perform at multiple events, 
<h3> My representation in the Music Leadership Camp 2020 </h3>
<p> I was selected to participant in the Music Leadership, which was organised by the Ministry of Education  </p>
<h4> Production of E-CCA Open-House Video 2020 </h4>
<p> When I returned from the Music Leadership Camp, I was tasked by my CCA teachers to do up a CCA video introducing our CCA to the Secondary One Students. 
<h5> My Reflections from producing the CCA video </h5>
<ul> 
<li> I was able to produce a decent video from producing in such a short time. Although there were some areas that need improvement, given the circumstances. </li>
<li> Areas for improvement: 
<ol> 
<li> Duration of the video. The duration of the video was too long and might be boring for our target audience: Sec1 students. As such, concise message and introduction should be needed. </li>
<li> Design and general structure of the video</li>
</ol> 
<li> One good part of the CCA video was that we were able to essentially cover the introduction of all our sections and a simple introduction from our EXCO members. </li>
</ul>
