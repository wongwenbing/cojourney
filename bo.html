<p> I was selected to be participate in the Singapore Youth Festival 2021 (SYF). When I first participated, I often felt a sense of nervousness and fearthat I would screw up. However, I was constantly being pushed on by my peers, seniors and instructors that would constantly motivate me to do my best.
<h3> Actual day of performance </h3> 
<p> We had to report early in the morning by 6am to have a final round of practice before leaving for the Singapore Conference Hall. Many of us were anxious and trying our best to stay calm. Before we left, we had a small pep talk by the principals, teachers who came to wish us good luck. </p> 
<h3>Our performance </h3>

<p> As seen from the performance, we kept our nerves and performed very well. After finishing the performance, the instructors applauded us for our adaptability and our performance. </p> 
<h3> Results </h3> 
<p> For just the second time in our orchestra's long history, our orchestra clinched a Certificate of Distinction! All of us were extremely happy and proud of ourselves. </p>
    
    <h3> Reflections </h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> In the process, we had encountered many difficulties such as in the heat of the pandemic, when we had to result to online video-practices. I believe this was the hardest part for us, as the instructors and us, students, all had difficulty attempting to demonstrate and play the song. At that time, everyone was still very new to video-conferencing platforms such as ZOOM, and this forced us to have resilience and adaptability. </li> 
        <li> This was my first time participating in the Singapore Youth Festival, and to me it was a fruitful experience as there were many different elements that contributed to our succcess - camaraderie, bond, trust. All these elements played the key role for our Distinction. </li>
